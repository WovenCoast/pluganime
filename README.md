# Todo

- [ ] Make class for initial client that interfaces everything
- [ ] Make class for AnimeProvider plugin (basically the API to access the anime in an anime website)
- [ ] Make class for AnimeWatcher plugin (reports to stuff like myanimelist or discord rpc or whatever else there is)
- [ ] Make class for AnimeIntegration plugin (website, electron app, whatever else)
- Note to self: its a bit like express plugins like session, passport, integration stuff :D
  - [ ] Allow optional reporting back for anime watcher plugins
